Hello,
I am a Full-Stack Developer with knowledge of many technologies and languages such as, JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, Flask and Postgres to list a few. Even though most of my time is happily spent as a developer either working on projects or learning new technologies and or languages, I like to think I am more than just a developer. Outside of software engineering I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, off roading, boating and exploring. Please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn so we can have a conversion! Hope you have a great rest of your day!
